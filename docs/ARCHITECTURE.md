# OUTLAW CITY — Architecture

Status: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (driving prototype). Last updated 2026-10-13.

## Source of truth and workflow

- **The Roblox Studio place is the source of truth.** Code is written directly in Studio through the Studio MCP. Rojo is intentionally not used.
- `src/` in this repo is a **read-only snapshot** exported from Studio after each tested milestone, so changes can be reviewed and diffed in git. Never edit `src/` and expect it to reach Studio.
- Only the primary integration agent edits the live Studio place (see `AGENTS.md`).
- Roblox's own place version history is the rollback mechanism for the live place; git tracks docs and source snapshots.

## Server / client responsibilities

| Concern | Server | Client |
|---|---|---|
| Vehicle spawn | Validates request, cooldown, picks free pad, builds model, seats player | Asks via `RequestSpawnVehicle`, shows result |
| Who simulates a car | Sets network owner + `SimulatedBy` attribute (driver, else owner, else server) | Runs `VehiclePhysics` only for cars where `SimulatedBy == LocalPlayer.UserId` |
| Driving physics | — (future: speed/teleport sanity checks) | Suspension, drive, grip, yaw, flip recovery |
| Seating / exit | `Seat:Sit`, prompt range check, unseat + safe exit position | Sends `RequestExitVehicle`, disables jump while driving |
| Camera, HUD, input | — | All of it |
| Money, arrests, purchases (later) | **Always server-authoritative** | Display and requests only |

## Boot order

- Server `Main`: `Remotes.createAll()` → `service.init()` for each service in order (World, Team, Vehicle) → `service.start()` for each → sets `Workspace.ServerReady` → in Studio runs unit tests (disable with `Workspace` attribute `RunTestsOnStart = false`).
- Client `Main`: `VehicleInputController.init()` → `VehicleController.init()` → `VehicleCameraController.init()` → `VehicleHudController.init()` → `TeamSelectController.init()` (spawned, waits for teams), then wires input action signals.
- HUD placement: the top-right corner belongs to Roblox's player list; game buttons live in the top-centre row.
- Dev tools (Phase 3+): Studio-only, created only when `RunService:IsStudio()` is true on the server, so they can never activate in published servers.
- Every service exposes `init()` (setup, may yield) and `start()` (connect runtime events). Every controller exposes `init()`.

## Network contract (event contracts)

All remotes live in `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Net.Remotes.Definitions`. Nothing else may create remotes.

| Remote | Type | Direction | Payload | Server validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestSpawnVehicle` | RemoteFunction | client → server | `(vehicleId: string) -> (ok: boolean, err: SpawnError?)` | string, 1–32 chars, known id, alive, 3 s cooldown, free pad |
| `RequestExitVehicle` | RemoteEvent | client → server | `()` | 0.5 s cooldown, caller must be in a `DriverSeat` under `Workspace.Vehicles` |
| `RequestJoinTeam` | RemoteFunction | client → server | `(teamId: string) -> (ok: boolean, err: JoinTeamError?)` | string, 1–32 chars, known team, not current team, max 2-player imbalance (`TeamRules`), 10 s cooldown after a successful switch |

`SpawnError = "BadRequest" | "UnknownVehicle" | "NotAlive" | "Cooldown" | "NoFreeSpawn"`.
`JoinTeamError = "BadRequest" | "UnknownTeam" | "AlreadyOnTeam" | "TeamFull" | "Cooldown"`.

Replicated attributes on each vehicle Model: `VehicleId`, `OwnerUserId`, `SimulatedBy`, `DriverUserId`.

Rules:
- Client → server remotes are named `Request<Verb><Noun>`; server → client pushes will be `On<Noun><Event>`.
- The server never invokes a RemoteFunction on a client.
- Every server handler type-checks every argument and rate-limits per player.

## Naming conventions

- Modules and instances: `PascalCase`. Server modules end in `Service`, client modules in `Controller`.
- Locals and functions: `camelCase`; module-level constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Types: `PascalCase`, exported from `Shared.Types` when shared.
- All modules start with `--!strict` and a one-line header comment saying what they own.
- Units: studs and seconds; speeds in studs/s (HUD converts to MPH with 1 stud = 0.28 m).

## Security rules

1. Treat every remote argument as hostile: check `typeof`, length and range before use.
2. Rate-limit every remote per player (`RateLimiter`).
3. Money, arrests, inventory and purchases are decided only on the server, never trusted from a client.
4. Clients may simulate only vehicles the server assigned to them (network ownership + `SimulatedBy`).
5. Known gap for Phase 3+: the simulating client controls its car's velocity, so a server-side speed and teleport sanity check is needed before any gameplay rewards depend on driving.
6. Tests and server code live outside `ReplicatedStorage` so clients cannot read them.

## Vehicle model

- One collidable, massed part (`Chassis`) carries physics; body panels, seat and wheels are massless, non-colliding visuals.
- Four raycast springs (anchor points in `VehicleStats.WheelOffsets`) push the chassis up; spring stiffness is derived from the live assembly mass so the car always rests at the configured compression, including with a driver.
- Throttle, braking, reverse, lateral grip and yaw are applied as velocity changes, which keeps handling responsive and independent of part friction. All of that maths lives in `VehicleMath` and is unit-tested.
- Wheels hang from `Motor6D`s; the simulating client animates suspension travel, steering and spin.
- A car on its roof for 2 s at low speed is flipped upright automatically.
